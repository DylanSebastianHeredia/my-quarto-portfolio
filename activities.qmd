## Music ##

I've played the viola for 10 years and music has contributed to so many of my 
most favorite experiences and memories. Through various fundraiser performances, 
seasonal concerts, weddings, and tours, I've met incredible people and life-long
friends.

### GarageBand Compositions ###

I've recorded myself making music since I was 9-years old. Through 
apps like Voice Memos, SoundTrap, and GarageBand, I learned to
layer multiple parts to create my own ensemble inside my room. 
Below are two of my first projects from high school.

  *Untitled*, 2021 
  <br><br>
  I really liked the opening theme to "Pressure" by Billy Joel and wondered
  what it would sound like if it were remixed. In this project, I was aiming
  for an ominous and dark tone, and I had a lot of fun layering parts!

  *Improvised Duet*, 2021 
  <br><br>
  Here, I chose the key of D minor and improvised a duet that I 
  played on my viola. Each part was recorded in one take. I love how 
  this piece captures a sense of reflection and optimism towards the end.

<p>
  Today, you'll find me jamming with my friends Kai Mawhinney on keys
  and Emmett Levine on voice and guitar. We've performed on the 
  Claremont College student radio, [KSPC](https://kspc.org/), several times
  and are incredibly thankful to them for hosting us. Click the icon to the 
  right to learn more about KSPC.

### Ultimate Frisbee ###

<p>
  The [Claremont Braineaters](https://linktr.ee/brainsult) are a group of frisbee enthusiasts from all over the Claremont Colleges. 
  We are an inclusive, gender expansive team and hold trainings three times a week for 2-hours to practice gameplay, strategy, 
  and have a good time. Last season, we represented the South West region at the Men's Division-III Nationals 2024 in Milwaukee, 
  earning the Team Spirit Award for outstanding knownledge of the game and sportsmanship. I've made countless memories with the 
  team both on and off field, and I'm excited to see where we go this season.

## Additional Interests & Hobbies
In addition to music and frisbee, I also enjoy sketching, running, and woodworking. This winter break, 
I'm working on running 100 miles!
